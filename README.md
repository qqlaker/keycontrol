# Keycontrol by LaKeR.
***
 Script developed for linux. Tested on ubuntu, but will work well on other.  
 On windows button will press single time instead of repeat.  
 Therefore you do not need 'release' command on windows.
***

1. Run main.py
2. Run client.py
3. In client.py send 'press button' or 'release button' (instead of 'button' you need to put any key from pip keyboard module)

Signal will be sent from client.py to main.py and do some action.
